		<h1>Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>This is a legally binding contract between you and Rescue Funder. Please make sure you read it, because it is important.</p>
		<h2>1. Definitions</h2>
		<p>We’re going to use some shorthand to make this easier to read. When we say “site,” we mean rescuefunder.com and the services offered through that site. When we say “we,” “us,” or “our,” we mean Rescue Funder. When we say “your content,” we mean any text, photos, videos or other material which you post, upload, or otherwise share on the site; similarly, when we say “Rescue Funder content,” we mean the copyrightable text, graphics, and other material owned by Rescue Funder. And when we say “terms,” we mean these terms of service.</p>
		<h2>2. Accepting these terms</h2>
		<p>Please read these terms before using the site. <em>If you do not agree to these terms, you may not register for the site.</em> If we make material changes to these terms, we’ll let you know either through the site or via email (at the email address you provide). If you do not agree to those changes, you may send a request to cancel your account to <a href="mailto:support@rescuefunder.com?subject=Terms%20of%20Service">support@rescuefunder.com</a>. If we do not hear from you within ten days, the revised terms <em>will</em> apply to you. </p>
		<h2>3. Privacy policy</h2>
		<p>When you register with the site, you will be asked to provide certain personal information, including your name and email address. You shall provide accurate, complete, and updated registration information. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of the Terms of Use, which may result in immediate termination of your account. We will store your personal information, but will not share it with any third parties, except as necessary to provide the services offered, to monitor usage, and to improve the service. For example, we may store your personal information along with your files and data on a third party server such as Amazon Web Services; or we may use a third party analytics tool like Google Analytics to learn how you are using Rescue Funder, and how we can improve that experience. We also use your personal information to send you notifications about the service and to respond to customer support requests. We will <em>never</em> share your personal information with advertisers or send you promotions for unrelated services. You can access and change your personal information or cancel your account by logging in to your account settings page.</p> 
		<p>We may be required to disclose your personal information in order to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>comply with the law or legal process;</li>
			<li>protect or defend our rights or property, or the rights or property of others;</li>
			<li>enforce these terms; or</li>
			<li>respond to claims that the content of any material on our system violates the rights of others.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If we must disclose your personal information in order to comply with the law or legal process, we will inform you (at the email address you provide) as soon as practicable, provided that it is lawful for us to do so.</p>
		<p>We will also aggregate user information and perform statistical analyses of the collective behavior of our members and visitors, to measure overall demographics, and to analyze how to improve our service. We may share this information with third parties (such as Google Analytics), but such aggregate information does not contain personal information other than IP addresses. In addition, we may compile and disclose aggregate information about our users for promotional or other purposes.</p>
		<p>We use session and login cookies, which help us keep track of when a person is logged in and determine the content or sites users link to, and which services people use. We will also capture login timestamps, and usage statistics, as well as IP addresses.</p>
		<p>We will communicate with you via email, to the email address you provide to us. Some communications, such as emails informing you of new features, may be unsubscribed to via the unsubscribe link in the email. If you would like to cease all communications from us, please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@rescuefunder.com?subject=Terms%20of%20Service">support@rescuefunder.com</a> and we will cancel your account.</p>
		<h2>4. Permitted users</h2>
		<p>Rescue Funder is designed for use by adults. You must be thirteen years of age or older to use it. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of thirteen, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under the age of thirteen, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@rescuefunder.com?subject=COPPA">support@rescuefunder.com</a>. When you use the site, you represent and warrant that you have the legal capacity to form a binding contract with us, and are doing so by your agreement to these terms.</p>
		<h2>5. Copyright and intellectual property</h2>
		<p>We own our stuff; you own yours.</p>

This license permits us to perform the services that you registered for; for example, it permits us to store your content on redundant data servers, but it <em>does not</em> permit us to sell your content to advertisers or any other third party. This license ends when you delete the material or your account.</p>
		<p>In addition, the site provides features that allow you to publically post your content with others. There are many things that others may do with that content, including copying it, modifying it, and re-sharing it. So, please consider carefully what you choose to post; we take no responsibility for that activity.</p>

Use of our content without our express prior written permission is strictly prohibited. </p>
